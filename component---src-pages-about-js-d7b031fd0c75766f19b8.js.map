Im Dave. During the day, I am a data scientist at Thomson Reuters Labs\n      in Boston, where I do typical data sciency things like building ML models,\n      etc, but more often than not, I am building Proof of Concepts (PoC's) that\n      require me to know the entire software stack. I have typically been very\n      Python heavy with some Javascript, but have found myself leaning more and\n      more to a full Javascript stack, the web community is just moving much\n      faster with Node/JS than with Python.\n    </p>\n    <br />\n    <p>\n      I am also very interested in generative art and you can see some of my\n      work on{\" \"}\n      <a style={{ color: \"blue\" }} href=\"https://observablehq.com/@dvreed77\">\n        Observable\n      </a>\n    </p>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport const query = graphql`\n  query AboutQuery {\n    site {\n      siteMetadata {\n        title\n      }\n    }\n  }\n`;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
