The World Check team, including Brian Huerbsch, Elvis Asiamah, and Andrew Alvarado-Sieg, working together with Joel Leeman and Ryan Sheppard from the comms team put together an editorial piece looking at the continuing corruption within FIFA. </p>\n<!-- World Cup 2018 in Russia is right around the corner and even aft -->\n<p>The purpose of this specific piece was to examine the scale of FIFA event-related spending and revenue including the World Cup. The data was gathered by manually curating financial data from each of the FIFA Financial reports between 2003 and 2017.  Reporting between 2003 and 2015 was fairly consistent, but in 2016 the report changed rather drastically, with FIFA deciding to defer FIFA related spending and revenue until 2018. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Revenue recognition now reflects the current underlying business, i.e. the majority of the revenue has been deferred to 2018 (FIFA World Cup year).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Due to this, FIFA reported losing money from events in 2016 and 2017, which conflicts with the reporting from the 3 previous World Cups. Since its unclear at this point how FIFA will report their financials in 2018 (a world cup year), I decided to estimate both revenue and spending by fitting 4 linear models for years 1,2,3 and 4 using the data from the previous 3 World Cups.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"FIFA Financials",startDate:"2018-04-20",endDate:"2018-05-07",repoURL:"http://google.com",projectURL:"/projects/dreed/projects/congressional_challenge",images:[{publicURL:"/members/dreed/static/fifa-financials-c3225733ff67bcfaf77a72da26500d4e.png"},{publicURL:"/members/dreed/static/fifa-financials-c3225733ff67bcfaf77a72da26500d4e.png"}]},fields:{path:"projects/fifa-financials.md",slug:"/projects/fifa-financials.html"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/projects/fifa-financials.html"}}}});
